# School Corporation Opportunity Score Dashboard for Indiana

![An AI-generated image of school corporation data analysis](scoscore.png)

This repository contains a dashboard for exploring the School Corporation Opportunity Scores for school
corporations across the state of Indiana.

School Corporation Opportunity Scores are a measure of the opportunity for students to succeed in a school based on
both structural factors, such as race and socioeconomics, as well as overall academic performance as measured by
standardized test scores and graduation pathway completion rates. For more information, see the
[SCO Scores documentation](https://jeremyfprice.github.io/scoscore/) 
([GitHub repository](https://github.com/jeremyfprice/scoscore)).

The dashboard is built using R and [Quarto R](https://quarto.org/r/) and deployed by GitHub Pages. The dashboard is
interactive in that you can interact with the visualizations and data tables.

The data itself can be found in the project's [OSF data repository](https://osf.io/chj38/?view_only=59cdee8e839a4c89b341dc35d9f2e6e0).

The dashboard is primarily provided to allow researchers at Indiana University-Indianapolis to identify high-opportunity
school corporations with whom to partner. However, the dashboard is also provided as a resource for anyone interested in
exploring the data. The caveats in the [SCO Scores documentation](https://jeremyfprice.github.io/scoscore/) apply to
this dashboard as well.
